# Take a break

A simple VS Code extension that helps protect your eyes by reminding you to take a break every 20 minutes (Inspired by the 20-20-20 rule).

## The 20/20/20 rule

The 20-20-20 rule advises taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes and looking at something 20 feet away. It helps reduce eye strain from prolonged screen use.

## Commands

**Take a break: Start**: Restarts showing the reminders.

**Note: **After installing the extension, reminders will be started automatically and then you can stop and start them using the previous commands.
